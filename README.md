# regex-cli
A simple command-line regular expression tool written in multiple languages.

## Note
As of right now, the tool is written in C++ and Java.
In the future, I intend to write a version in Go.

The executable(s) are inside the *bin* directory. You can also build from source, given that you have the necessary toolchain(s). 

*Note:* Ensure that you have a Java runtime installed on your system in order to run .class executable(s).

#### Inside the directory, you will find a README file with further instructions on how to run the program in that language.
Finally, if you are interested in the various considerations made during development, please look into <a href="https://github.com/DreamLineLove/regex-cli/blob/main/SPECIFICATION.md">SPECIFICATION.md</a>.
