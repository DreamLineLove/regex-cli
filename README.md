# regex-cli
A simple command line tool to analyze strings using regular expressions.

## Contents
As of right now, the tool is written in C++. 
I intend to write it again in Go in the future.

The executable is inside the *bin* directory. You can also build from source.
<!--
### Go
```
regex-cli/
    go/
      regex-cli.go
      bin/
        regex-cli-go
```

```

## Usage
 
- First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/DreamLineLove/regex-cli.git
```
- Choose your preferred language and run the program:
```
    $ ./cpp/bin/regex-cli-cpp
```
or
```

- Run the program as above (without any flags) and you will be greeted with helpful instructions.
